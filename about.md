Hi! I am Zafar, currently working as a full stack developer at an amazing company called [IDfy](https://www.idfy.com/) located in Mumbai. I have been a part of a coding Bootcamp ["Jaaga"](https://www.jaaga.in/study), which is situated in Bangalore, it is one of the most amazing place to be at, if you wanna learn to code. I have also worked at [Mountblue Technologies](https://www.mountblue.io/) where I learnt Python and a bit of React.

I am from a non technical background, so currently my focus is to take myself to such a level that being from a non technical background doesn't bother me that much. I have made my own [tech curriculum](https://github.com/mdaz78/Coding-Curriculum) that I am following to improve my tech and mathematical skills.

If you have any questions, doubts or suggestions please feel free to shoot me an email.
