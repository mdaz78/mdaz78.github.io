---

I'll be starting my #100DaysOfCode from today. So basically
the rules for 100 days of code is you need to code for an hour or more everyday and
you need to tweet your daily progress with the #100DaysOfCode. My main aim from the 100
days of coding journey is to improve as a developer. I will be mainly focusing on learning
javascript, react, redux, node, improving my knowledge of data structures and algorithms
and of course my favorite editor vim, I so wanna master it.

I am not exactly sure of the tutorials, blogs or books I'll be following but as of now,
for javascript and other web dev stuff I am thinking to learn as much as possible from [freecodecamp.com](), 
their tutorials are pretty good, and I am also starting a bootcamp from Monday, so I'll mostly 
be learning from the resources they suggest as well. 
For vim I am planning to start with [learnvimscriptthehardway](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/), then move on to practical vim and 
after that to modern vim both the books are by Drew Neil. I also plan to watch a vimcast every other day
if I get time to do so.

I hope to blog about my learning every other weekend and hope to be regular with it. Fingers crossed.
