As we all know how important it is to constantly develop your skills in the world
of software development. So I planned on creating a self learning
curriculum to develop my Mathematics and Coding Skills. Since I am from a non mathematical background 
the curriculum is mainly focused on strengthening my mathematical skills.

The curriculum is divided into three major categories **Mathematics**, **Core CS** and **Specialization Courses**.
It also has a list of books and blogs. You can go **[here](https://github.com/mdaz78/Coding-Curriculum)**
and have a look at the curriculum, any suggestions to the curriculum is welcome. The curriculum is currently a 
work in progress.

I am planning to devote around 20-25 hours a week working on the curriculum starting from 25 June 2018. I will
try to be as consistent as possible and would be blogging about my progress on a regular basis, most probably I 
will be sharing my weekly progress.

By the end of the curriculum I am hoping to have developed strong Mathematical and Algorithm skills, and 
also have improved my over all programming skills.

The **Specialization Courses** are mainly focussed on web development. As I am a full stack developer, I am 
planning to improve my self more on that frontier.
