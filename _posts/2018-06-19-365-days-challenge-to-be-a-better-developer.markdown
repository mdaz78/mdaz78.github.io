As we all know how important it is to constantly develop your skills in the world of software development. So I planned on creating a self learning curriculum to develop my Mathematics and Coding Skills. Since I am from a non mathematical background the curriculum is mainly focused on strengthening my mathematical skills.

The curriculum is divided into three major categories **Mathematics**, **Core CS** and **Specialization Courses**. It also has a list of books and blogs. You can go **[here](https://github.com/mdaz78/Coding-Curriculum)** and have a look at it, any suggestions to the curriculum is welcome.

I'm planning to devote around 12-15 hours a week working on the curriculum starting from 25 June 2018 and I am also planning to solve at least one question from [hacker rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms). I will try to be as consistent as possible and would be blogging about my progress on a regular basis, most probably I will be posting once a week. The curriculum is pretty vast, so my target is to finish as many courses as I possibly can in 365 days.

By the end of the curriculum I am hoping to have developed strong Mathematical and Algorithm skills, and also have improved my over all programming abilities.

The **Specialization Courses** are mainly focussed on web development. As I am a full stack developer, I am planning to improve my self more on that frontier. I'm also targeting to be regular with my github commits, so that I can actually share my progress with everybody.
